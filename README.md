## Project Overview
This project is based on the ESP32-S3 microcontroller, which serves as the main processing unit. The system utilizes a BME280 sensor to measure temperature, humidity, and atmospheric pressure.

The system runs on FreeRTOS, enabling efficient real-time task management. 
Development is carried out using ESP-IDF (Espressif IoT Development Framework), which provides essential tools and libraries for hardware control and communication.

Communication Interfaces
### I2C – used for interfacing with the BME280 sensor
### Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) – enables wireless data transmission between components
